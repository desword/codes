# LT_code

with robustBOliton distribution, and message passing decoding method.

# Dare code

message passing decoding method.

# spinal code

extracted from sigcomm 12 paper code.
Should on ubuntu that relies on numpy. 

# gaussion_elination_LT_random_linear

implemneted LT and random linear code using gaussion elimination decoding. It is extracted from the raptor code website. The condition of determine is_full_rank is erroreous. And The actual number of needed blocks for recovering the original data is smaller. The original program will run non terminal. We just extract the gaussion implementation. 

It should run on ubuntu that relies on numpy.
